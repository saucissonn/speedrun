This module is loaded as "text/javascript", for backward compatibility, providing globals to
avoid failure of old codes.

Purposes/notes:

  - hooks files using subscribeWhenReady

  - MathJax replacements through custom_dir override. Note that, in addition to keep backward
    compatibility, loading mathjax-libs.js in a synch way also simplifies A LOT getting everything
    right at load time (because the mathjax cdn is loaded sync...)

  - The functions defined here are available in the global scope, but won't override the ones
    defined in the modules: those are explicitly imported where needed, in the modules.
    On the other hand, jsLogger becomes unusable in non modules...

  - The modules will override this globals with their own once they are loaded
